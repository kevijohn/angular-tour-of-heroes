# AngularTourOfHeroes

This is my Angular Tour of Heroes app.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.  My app is my best friend.  It is my life.  I must master it as I master my life.  Without me, my app is useless.  Without my app, I am useless.  I must code my app true.  I must code more cleanly than the bugs that are trying to crash my app.  My app and I know that what counts in the biz is not the lines of code I write, nor the number of commits I make, nor the number of stars on our repo.  We know that it is e2e testing that counts.  We will pass.
